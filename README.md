# Happiness Data Visualization
## Description
This project aims to analyze and visualize the factors influencing happiness across various countries. Using data from the World Happiness Report, we explore key indicators such as GDP per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, freedom to make life choices, generosity, and perceptions of corruption. The goal is to understand how these factors contribute to happiness and to provide insights that can help policymakers, researchers, and organizations improve the quality of life.

## Current Status
I am currently working on a research paper based on this analysis and continuously improving my findings. The project is a work in progress, and I am actively refining the data and visualizations to ensure accuracy and relevance.

## Data Source
